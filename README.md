- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SNat41518
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cell Bender
- Cell Bender (current version)
- python=3.9.5  or 3.7.0
- anaconda (miniconda3)
-
- CelBender does not run well in my account of a linux server (NO GPU).
- 
- It stopped showing the error message as follows:
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tables/__init__.py", line 99, in <module>
    from .utilsextension import (
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tables.utilsextension'   
-
- Please let me know how to amend CellBender and/or its environment to completely run
-
